    <h2>Steak frites, (French: “steak [and] fries”) a simple dish of beef steak alongside strips of deep-fried potato, commonly known as french fries</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ribeye steak</li>
        <li>Russet potatoes</li>
        <li>Refined peanut oil</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Allow your steak to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Peel your potatoes and slice them to your liking. We recommend ⅓- inch thick slices. Add your cut potatoes to a large bowl filled with ice water and let sit for 15 minutes. Drain and pat dry.</li>
        <li>Fry time! Fill your pot with 2-inches of oil and heat to 300°F. Cook your potatoes for 3-4 minutes and use a slotted spoon to place the fries on a paper towel lined baking sheet. Increase your oil temperature to 350°F.</li>
        <li>Steak time! Pat your steak dry with a paper towel, heat your skillet over high heat until you see smoke, and add your oil.</li>
        <li>Generously season your steaks with salt and place in the skillet. Sear for 4 minutes without flipping (seriously, no flipping yet). Flip your steak at the 4 minute mark and cook for an additional two minutes or until an internal temp of 140° for medium rare and 155°F for medium.</li>
    </ol>
